                                   Voters Model Cellular Automata



The zip file includes following files:

voter.ma	the definition of the cellular model "voter"
voter.scp	the simulation script for the celular model "voter"
voter.pal	the palette file for the celluar model "voter"

voter2.ma	the definition of the cellular model "voter2"
voter2.scp	the simulation script for the celular model "voter2"
voter2.pal	the palette file for the celluar model "voter2" (exactly same as voter.pal)

Running Instruction:
1. type "make" to generate simu.exe and drawlog.exe (use the default makefile in CD++) 
2. type the script file name (e.g. "voter.scp") to create .drw file and .log file.
3. use online applet to visulize the results by choosing the .ma file, .drw file and .pal file.

Note: It needs nearly 10M disk space to generate the .drw and .log files. The simulation takes some time.
